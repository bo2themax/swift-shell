# üêö Swift Shell

![Swift v5.10](https://img.shields.io/badge/swift-v5.10-orange.svg)
![platform macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-macOS-blue.svg)

Library for running shell scripts and other executables from swift code.

## üìñ Documentation

The library is distributed as a swift package.

```swift
// in your Package.swift, add package dependency:
.package(url: "https://github.com/darrarski/swift-shell.git", from: "0.1.0"),

// and add the library as a dependency to your target:
.product(name: "SwiftShell", package: "swift-shell"),
```

The code is dressed in documentation comments that explain the purpose of each variable and function. The examples described below and the library [unit tests](Tests/SwiftShellTests) explain how to use it.

### Examples

Run bash script, send input, and retrieve the script's output:

```swift
let process = ShellProcess(.bash("IFS= read -r NAME; echo Hello, $NAME!"))
try await process.run()
try await process.send(input: "Swift\n".data(using: .utf8)!)
let output = try await process.output()!
print(String(data: output, encoding: .utf8)!) // Hello, Swift!
```
